# Project Submission: Data and Model Versioning with DVC and MLflow

## Overview
This repository contains the implementation of data version control (DVC) and model experiment tracking (MLflow), as per the project guidelines. The following files are included:

- `prepare.ipynb`: Preprocesses raw data, splits it into train, validation, and test sets, and tracks dataset versions using DVC.
- `train.ipynb`: Trains benchmark models (Naive Bayes, Logistic Regression, Random Forest) and logs experiments using MLflow.

## Note Regarding Late Submission
I apologize for submitting this project past the deadline. Unfortunately, I was unwell during this period and also could not appear for the mid-semester examination. I had already communicated my health situation and received prior permission from the professor regarding these circumstances.

Thank you very much for your understanding and consideration.
